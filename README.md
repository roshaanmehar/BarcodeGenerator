üöÄ The Ultimate EAN-13 Barcode Generation Suite üöÄ
A revolutionary, dual-interface toolkit engineered for seamless, enterprise-grade EAN-13 barcode generation. This suite transforms raw CSV data into high-fidelity barcode assets with unparalleled speed and efficiency, catering to both interactive web use and automated backend workflows.

‚ú® Key Features & Innovations
This isn't just a generator; it's a complete data-to-image pipeline, meticulously crafted for performance and user experience.

Intelligent CSV Parsing: Ingests any CSV file, automatically detecting headers and data structures with a sophisticated parsing engine.

Dynamic Data Mapping: Empowers the user with an intuitive interface to precisely select the correct data column, ensuring 100% accuracy.

High-Fidelity EAN-13 Generation: Utilizes a best-in-class generation core to produce crystal-clear, fully compliant EAN-13 barcode images, complete with automatic checksum calculation.

Instantaneous ZIP Archiving: Gathers, compresses, and delivers a complete archive of all generated barcodes in a single .zip file, ready for immediate deployment in your production environment.

Unparalleled Security & Privacy (Web Interface): A groundbreaking, serverless architecture that runs entirely in the user's browser. No data is ever uploaded, offering absolute confidentiality and security for sensitive product information.

Robust CLI Backend Engine: A powerful, scriptable Python engine for developers and system administrators. Perfect for integration into automated scripts, server-side tasks, and large-scale batch processing.

Comprehensive Processing & Error Logs: A transparent logging system provides real-time feedback, highlighting successes and gracefully managing any data anomalies for effortless debugging.

Sleek, Intuitive User Interface: A modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS provides a frictionless user experience, guiding the user from upload to download in seconds.

üèõÔ∏è A Tale of Two Interfaces: A Dual-Pronged Solution
This suite was architected with a unique, dual-interface philosophy to conquer any use case.

1. The Web Application (The Client-Side Powerhouse)
Our flagship web interface is a marvel of modern web engineering. By leveraging the raw power of JavaScript, PapaParse, and JSZip, it performs all operations‚Äîfrom CSV parsing to API-based image fetching and ZIP creation‚Äîdirectly on the client machine. This is the ultimate tool for individuals and teams who need a quick, visual, and incredibly secure way to generate barcodes on the fly.

Technology Stack (Frontend):

UI Framework: HTML5 & Tailwind CSS

Core Logic: JavaScript (ES6+)

CSV Parsing: PapaParse

ZIP Generation: JSZip

Barcode API: barcodeapi.org

2. The Python CLI (The Backend Workhorse)
For power-users and system integrators, the Python-based Command-Line Interface offers limitless potential. Built on a robust foundation of the python-barcode and Pillow libraries, this engine generates barcode images locally with blazing speed. It's the perfect solution for automating inventory updates, integrating with larger data processing pipelines, or running massive batch jobs on a server.

Technology Stack (Backend/CLI):

Language: Python 3

Barcode Generation: python-barcode

Image Handling: Pillow (via ImageWriter)

Core Libraries: os, csv, re
